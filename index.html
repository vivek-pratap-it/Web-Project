                I found the service standards of Indiaart of a very high order and I have no doubt that yours is an organization that can be relied upon for adopting high standards. The Ganesha that you sent to me in Australia was well packed and came through well.

                Kudos for a wonderful experience of purchasing Art at your website! IndiaArt.com is, to a large extent, beyond criticism and has the potential to be the "iTunes for Art". Boasting of a vast choice of works from a wide array of Artists including professional, emerging as well as child artists. There really is something for everyone. What's more, I was impressed with the personalized service provided by IndiaArt.com right from selection to actual delivery of the Art works. Keep up the good work!<br><b> - A. Chopra, New Delhi
